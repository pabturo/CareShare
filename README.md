# CareShare the App

Welcome to CareShare!

In hectic and difficult times, it’s easy to get caught engaging in
activities you don’t want to do, or struggling to find time for the activities that you do want to do.

We wish to provide a platform for people to track and share their
hobbies and habits in order to motivate them to continue doing them and help keep friends accountable.

**With Ones You Care, Share What You Care.**
