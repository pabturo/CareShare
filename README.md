# CareShare the App

Welcome to CareShare!

In hectic and difficult times, it’s easy to get caught engaging in
activities you don’t want to do, or struggling to find time for the activities that you do want to do.

We wish to provide a platform for people to track and share their
hobbies and habits in order to motivate them to continue doing them and help keep friends accountable.

**With Ones You Care, Share What You Care.**

To run this project, you must have node (https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x) and expo (https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) installed. 

Then, set up your iOS simulator: Install Xcode through the Apple App Store. It’ll take a while. Next, open up Xcode. In the top bar, go to XCode > preferences and click the Components tab. Install iOS 14.x simulator from the list.
Once this is done, you should be able to open “simulator” as a separate app on your macOS without needing XCode to be running.

OR 

Test on your own device: On your phone, install the Expo client. Make sure your phone and laptop are on the same network.
Once it is done, on your computer, start the project. Click on the “Send link with email/SMS”. Enter your email/phone, and wait until you get the email/phone with the link to open. Once you open the link, it will open the already installed client app, and you should see a progress percentage on your laptop and phone. Loading the app will take a few minutes. Once it’s done, you should see your app. You can access the settings menu mentioned above by shaking the device since there is no keyboard. The app on your phone will refresh immediately when you change the App.js file! 


Once this environment is set up and you have cloned the repo: Launch the simulator. Run expo start in the app directory. Click “Run on iOS simulator”. Enjoy!
